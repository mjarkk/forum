# Forum
Make a forum as school project using javascript and PHP.  
I have added React to this project myself to learn a bit :D

## PHP Setup
Make a softlink from build to you'r webserver

## Dev Setup
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `npm i -g webpack webpack-cli yarn` (on linux you might need to add `sudo`)
- `yarn`
- `yarn build`

## Maybe?
- Add docker setup file
